        <p>Hey there!</p>

<p>This project contains code written to understand and play around with concurrent data structures during my undergraduate thesis. Art of Multiprocessor Programming has been the book that I started my learning with. So, the programming style is hugely inspired from that amazingly written book :)</p>

<p>Apart from implementing some non-trivial code from the book, I have also tried to re-construct data structures that have appeared in reputed journals. The map is given explicitly in the README file.</p>

<p>Testing correctness of implementations has been a non-trivial task, and mostly done on paper, wildly thinking about the points of linearization :)</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
