Art of Multiprocessor Programming has been the book that I started my learning with. So, the programming style is hugely inspired from that amazingly written book :)\r\n\r\nApart from implementing some non-trivial code from the book, I have also tried to re-construct data structures that have appeared in reputed journals. The map is given explicitly in the README file.\r\n\r\nTesting correctness of implementations has been a non-trivial task, and mostly done on paper, wildly thinking about the points of linearization :)\r\n\r\nCheers!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
